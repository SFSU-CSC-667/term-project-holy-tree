      <h3>What is Werewolf?</h3>

      <h5>How to Play</h5>
        <p>
          Gameplay begins in the Night Phase. Each player is given a role, and can see a description of their role and actions. As the game continues and players take those actions, night changes to Day. During the Day Phase players chat with each other to determine what action may have been taken on them, and who holds each role. The goal of the werewolves is to not be found out; the goal of all other roles is to determine who the wolves were. Use the power of deduction to come out alive.
